# PythonHasher https://travis-ci.org/0x00f/PythonHasher.svg?branch=master
Create multiple hashes quickly with drag and drop.

1 - Save the python script wherever you like, although a filepath without spaces " " is a good idea.
    C:\PythonScripts would be fine.
    
2 - Save the BASH file somewhere convenient like the Desktop. Then edit it to match your computers Python install directory and the directory where the python file is saved.

3 - Select all files in a single folder for which you require a hash. Drag the selected files with your mouse and drop them onto the BASH file.

4 - A hash.txt text file is created in the folder, containing hashes of all selected files:
     filename  |  sha hash  [SHA256] 
     filename  |  sha hash  [SHA256]
     .
     .
     .
